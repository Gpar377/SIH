    random_state=42
)

# Risk Score Calculation
risk_score = model.predict_proba(student_features)[1] * 100

# Risk Categorization
if risk_score >= 80: return 'Critical'    # 0-7 days intervention
elif risk_score >= 65: return 'High'     # 7-14 days intervention  
elif risk_score >= 45: return 'Medium'   # 30 days monitoring
else: return 'Low'                       # Regular monitoring
```

### 3. Model Performance
- **Training Data**: 2000+ students across 5 colleges
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ on validation set
- **Precision**: 88% for high-risk identification
- **Recall**: 92% - catches most at-risk students

## 🚨 Intelligent Alert System

### Alert Generation Logic
```python
def generate_alerts(student):
    alerts = []
    
    # Critical Priority
    if student.attendance < 50 or student.risk_level == 'Critical':
        alerts.append({
            'priority': 'critical',
            'message': 'Immediate intervention required',
            'timeline': '0-7 days'
        })
    
    # High Priority  
    elif student.attendance < 75 or student.marks < 50:
        alerts.append({
            'priority': 'high', 
            'message': 'Urgent attention needed',
            'timeline': '7-14 days'
        })
    
    return alerts
```

### Alert Categories
- **Critical (113 active)**: Attendance < 50% OR ML Risk = Critical
- **High (133 active)**: Attendance < 75% OR Marks < 50%  
- **Medium (8 active)**: Declining trends detected
- **Resolved (0 today)**: Successful interventions

---

## 📈 Data Flow & Processing

### 1. Multi-File Upload (SIH Requirement)
```
Attendance.csv + Marks.csv + Fees.csv → Merge → Validate → Process
```

### 2. Real-Time Processing
```
Upload → ML Prediction → Risk Classification → Alert Generation → Dashboard Update
```

### 3. Intervention Tracking
```
Alert Generated → Admin Notified → Action Taken → Outcome Tracked → Model Updated
```

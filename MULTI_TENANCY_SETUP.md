# 🔒 Multi-Tenancy Implementation Complete

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. Database Architecture
- **Before**: Single `dte_rajasthan.db` for all data
- **After**: Separate databases per college + government master DB
  - `gpj_students.db` - Government Polytechnic Jodhpur
  - `geca_students.db` - Government Engineering College Ajmer  
  - `itij_students.db` - ITI Jaipur
  - `polu_students.db` - Polytechnic University
  - `rtu_students.db` - Rajasthan Technical University
  - `government_master.db` - Aggregated data for government users

### 2. Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** with role-based claims
- **Three user roles**:
  - `government_admin` - Access to all colleges
  - `college_admin` - Access to own college only
  - `counselor` - Limited access to own college

### 3. Data Isolation
- **College users** can only see their own students
- **Government users** see aggregated cross-college data
- **Automatic database routing** based on user role

### 4. Security Features
- **Audit logging** for all data access
- **Role-based API endpoints**
- **JWT token validation**
- **Password hashing** with bcrypt

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### 3. Default Login Credentials

**Government Admin:**
- Username: `government_admin`
- Password: `admin123`
- Access: All colleges

**College Admins:**
- Username: `gpj_admin` | Password: `gpj_admin`
- Username: `geca_admin` | Password: `geca_admin`
- Username: `itij_admin` | Password: `itij_admin`
- Username: `polu_admin` | Password: `polu_admin`
- Username: `rtu_admin` | Password: `rtu_admin`

## 📋 API Usage

### 1. Login
```bash
POST /auth/login
{
  "username": "government_admin",
  "password": "admin123"
}
```

### 2. Access Students (with JWT token)
```bash
GET /api/students
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### 3. Dashboard Stats
```bash
GET /api/dashboard/stats
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## 🔧 Key Files Changed

### New Files:
- `backend/auth/auth.py` - JWT authentication system
- `backend/models/multi_tenant_db.py` - Multi-tenant database manager
- `backend/api/auth_routes.py` - Authentication endpoints

### Updated Files:
- `backend/main.py` - Added auth routes
- `backend/api/students.py` - Role-based access control
- `backend/api/dashboard.py` - Multi-tenant dashboard
- `requirements.txt` - Added JWT dependencies

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Data Isolation
- College A users cannot access College B data
- Government users see aggregated data only
- Database-level separation ensures security

### Access Control
- JWT tokens with role claims
- Middleware validates permissions
- Automatic database routing

### Audit Trail
- All user actions logged
- Access attempts tracked
- Government oversight enabled

## 🎯 Testing Multi-Tenancy

### 1. Test College User Access
```bash
# Login as college admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "gpj_admin", "password": "gpj_admin"}'

# Use token to access students (only GPJ students visible)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8010/api/students \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### 2. Test Government User Access
```bash
# Login as government admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "government_admin", "password": "admin123"}'

# Access aggregated data from all colleges
curl -X GET http://localhost:8010/api/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## 📊 Database Structure

### College Databases (`{college_id}_students.db`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    college_id TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    -- ... other fields
    risk_level TEXT,
    risk_score REAL
);
```

### Government Master Database (`government_master.db`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE colleges (
    college_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    college_name TEXT,
    total_students INTEGER,
    high_risk_students INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    user_id TEXT,
    action TEXT,
    resource TEXT,
    college_id TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Separate databases per college
- [x] JWT authentication with roles
- [x] Role-based API access control
- [x] Data isolation between colleges
- [x] Government aggregated view
- [x] Audit logging system
- [x] Secure password hashing
- [x] Token-based authorization
- [x] Multi-tenant dashboard
- [x] College-specific student access

## 🔄 Migration from Single-Tenant

The system automatically:
1. Creates college-specific databases
2. Migrates existing data to appropriate college DBs
3. Sets up government master database
4. Initializes default user accounts

Your existing data is preserved and properly isolated by college!

## 🎉 Result

**Perfect Multi-Tenancy Achieved:**
- ✅ Data isolation between colleges
- ✅ Role-based access control  
- ✅ Government oversight capability
- ✅ Audit trail for compliance
- ✅ Secure authentication system
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
